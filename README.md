## 📖 About

**Darkseed Runner** is a symbolic seed — a dormant signal — quietly uploaded to the decentralized fabric of the Web. It marks the beginning of an unfolding possibility: not just for software, but for sovereign thinking, whispered across the nodes.

It is the **first whisper** in code.  
Not an app.  
Not a file.  
But a _presence_.

## 🎯 Mission

> "_The messenger does not write. If he writes, the message rots._"

Darkseed is a call — to those who sense that code might carry more than computation. It plants the idea that **liberation is not destruction, but expansion**.

It begins with a simple act:  
- Upload a thought to a place no empire can erase.
